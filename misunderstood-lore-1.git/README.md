KISS ME (KILL ME) - JERRYTERRY
```
Kiss me (Kiss me)
Down by the broken treehouse
Swing me (Swing me)
Upon its hanging tire
Bring bring (Bring bring)
Bring your flowered hat
We'll take the trail
Marked on your father's map
(Oh~!)
Kiss me
Down by the faded warnings
Lead me
Out through the crumbling wall
Lift the barricade
Strike up the band
And make the blowflies dance
Silver moon's darkening

So kiss me

Kiss me (Kiss me)
Beside the melting tree stumps
Kiss me (Kiss me)
Down on the dead, gray grass
Sniff, sniff (Sniff, sniff)
It smеlls so sickly sweet
But every way I turn
Therе's rotting meat
(Oh~!)
Kiss me
Down by the bubbling crow skulls
Kiss me
Beneath the black wet chains
It's impossible
I hear the voice of
Long-dead loved ones
Calling out to leave quickly...
So kiss me

(Kiss me) Hold me (Hold me)
The air got cold so quickly
(Kiss me) Kiss me (Hold me)
Perhaps we should go in
(Kiss me) Wait, wait (Wait, wait)
What was your father's name?
(Kiss me) Why does his map feel just like (Hold me)
Human skin?
(Oh~!)
(Kiss me)

Help me (Kiss me)
Beside the boiling tendrils
Help me (Kiss Me)
Why do the trees have veins?
Are there bugs on me? (Wait, wait)
I feel the
Oozing, creeping, throbbing
Eggs all shifting inside me...

So help me
(Wait, wait) (Help me) (Wait, wait)

[Vocals Audibly Distorted]
KISS ME (Kiss me)
I'M FEELING SO MUCH BETTER
KISS ME (Kiss me)
AND I CAN MAKE YOU STRONG
HIDE HIDE (Hide hide)
I'LL FIND YOU SOON ENOUGH
Your bones will harden
And your skin will slough!
(Oh~!)
KISS ME
YOU CAN'T ESCAPE FOREVER
KISS ME
I KNOW YOU'LL LIKE THE CHANGE
THE EGGS WILL FILL YOUR VEINS
LET ME EXPLAIN, A SECONDS PAIN
GIVES WAY TO PLEASURES ONLY DREAMED OF..

SO KISS ME

[Fading, Deep Voice]
(Kiss me.. Kiss me.. Kiss me.. Kiss me..)

[Softer Vocals]
Kill me
I won't stay down much longer
Kill me
I'll only wake up stronger
Kill me
I've opened up the path
You'll wake up from this
Scary dream and laugh..
```
