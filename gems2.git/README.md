2. Run "rustup component add llvm-tools-preview" (no quotes)

# Tutorial

1. Create a new directory with a decent name "example: gems-exp-build"
2. Put this project in there too (again, keep it in the folder it comes with and it's name!)
3. cd into "gems2-main"
4. run compile.sh
5. if things break, try doing what the mythically magic terminal tells you to do.
6. repeat steps 4 and 5
