# Toontown Classic
Welcome to the Toontown Classic project!

# Source Code
This source code is based on Toontown School House, a project deticated to teaching people like myself Panda3d, Python, and the basics of making a Toontown Private Server. That is based off of a March 2019 fork of Toontown Offline v1.0.0.0 combined with a bit of Toontown Stride (Python 2.7) code. It has been stripped of all Toontown Offline exclusive features (this broke things I had to fix), except the magic words system and estate music. The new-ish Magic Words system made for Toontown Offline has been left alone, and upgraded to the most recent build. This feature will allow admins to easily navigate around Toontown without any hassle.
