### Usage

```sh
curl -fsSL https://git.io/v7K5W > interjection.sh
sh interjection.sh
```

As the output can be quite large, you may want to pipe the stdout to a clipboard interface like `xclip`, like so:

```sh
sh interjection.sh | xclip -i
```

Or upload to a pastebin of your choice. Here's an example:

```sh
sh interjection.sh | curl -F c=@- https://ptpb.pw
```
