# bitkraken *DEPRECATED*
## For educational purposes only.
Bitkraken but I accidentally deleted the old one. üò¢
Credit to HysMagus for keeping my original code so I could see how I did it. üëçüèª
However, most of the code is changed, since most of the code had bad practices, as I was only 16 at the time.
By the way this basically finds bitcoin private keys
by converting words to SHA256 sums. 

On Ubuntu 20.04 it only depends on Bitcoin Core, in the bitcoin/ directory, which you can find [here.](https://bitcoin.org/en/download)

# Note: This code is dumb. 
If you want stuff that works better (by that I mean it actually functions somewhat) see my newest revisions:
* BitKrackenJS (the original BitKracken but as large as the blockchain [almost infinite, no word lists here!], less hacky, and works)
* BitKrackenJS-bip39 (BitKrackenJS but uses bip39, a tiny bit more hacky than BitKrackenJS, and a bit faster. [Limited to 18 words at a time from the top of my head] )
