# Project: SwitchJoy
***(Homebrew - (Severe Exploits + Bricks + Bans)) + HTML/JS/CSS = Magic***


## What is it?

Deprecated, thats what. 

## Why?

* i hated myself for this.
* i hated how i treated oklomsy, and i wish to move on from that chapter of my life.
* frontend.js (my new project) can do all this and more. :-)

## But wait, can I do it on a LAN?

sure but it's no longer supported, use frontend.js instead.

## No more contributors.
I need a break from SwitchJoy. Forever. And honestly we all do. Thanks to all those who contributed over the years! :-)
