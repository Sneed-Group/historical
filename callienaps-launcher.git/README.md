free launcher for callienaps (archived due to byfron)

## NOTE
WE DO NOT ENDORSE UNAUTHORIZED HACKING, INCLUDING HACKING GAMES TO GET AN ADVANTAGE. THIS TOOL IS SIMPLY FOR REVERSE ENGINEERING, DEBUGGING, EDUCATION, AND BUG HUNTING PURPOSES.

Also note we do use fluxus but only to bootstrap our code, as well as for a backup if anything goes wrong.

## First time guide.
First you need to go get Homebrew at **https://brew.sh**, then simply run:

brew install pgrep wget && chmod +x launch.sh

Then, all you have to do whenever you first launch ROBLOX and you want to hack is type in "./launch.sh"
