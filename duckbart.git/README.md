# duckbart
A source-available and contributable alternative to ChatGPT and BingGPT (if you start your question with ANS: or GPT-J doesn't understand...), under a modified MIT license.

## NOTE!

Requires modules "duckduckgo3" and "requests", as well as a huggingface user key.

## Also, to quote bing.com/new as of 2/9/2023...
"How does the new Bing generate responses?

Bing searches for relevant content across the web and then summarizes what it finds to generate a helpful response. It also cites its sources, so you're able to see links to the web content it references." --bing.com/new (2/9/2023)

## Disclaimer

This does NOT provide sources/references, and the answers function almost NEVER provides accurate information in our testing. This is just testing what Public AI can do when combined with an instant answers platform.
