## Prerequisites

* [node + npm](https://nodejs.org/) (tested with v16.13.0)

## Setup

```
npm install
```

## Build

In order to test or distribute the extension, you must first build the TypeScript into a JavaScript bundle using one of the following commands (based on the target browser):

**Chrome:**

```
npm run build:chrome
```

**Edge:**

```
npm run build:edge
```

**Firefox:**

```
npm run build:firefox
```

**Safari:**

[See here](safari/README.md) for more complete Safari instructions.

In addition to rebuilding the JavaScript extension with this command, you will also need to [re-build the Xcode Swift project as well for Safari](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/safari_web_extensions/running_your_safari_web_extension#3744471) each time you make a change.

```
npm run build:safari
```


## Build in watch mode

You can also run the following command to automatically re-build the extension each time you change any of the source files using the `watch` script instead of `build`:

```
npm run watch:<chrome|edge|firefox|safari>
```

### Visual Studio Code

Run watch mode in VS Code:

type `Ctrl + Shift + B`

## Load extension to Chrome/Edge

1. Go to `about:extensions` or open Window -> Extensions
2. Enable "developer mode"
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `dist` directory

## Test

`npx jest` or `npm run test`
