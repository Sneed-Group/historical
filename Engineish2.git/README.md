# Engineish2 *(WIP)*
Open source ROBLOX-like, javascript first engine. Making it easier for devs to transition their games outside ROBLOX, as well as newbies to game development to create a game for free. (A user-friendly THREE.js/Peer.js wrapper)

# FAQ

## Is this any way referenced from the ROBLOX source code?
No! In fact, I've made this completely from years of knowledge of ROBLOX place and web backend development. This is probably my greatest work yet.

## So give me a few words that describes this simply, none of that developer jargon.
An easy to use, sane game engine for most. A neat way to escape from ROBLOX's grasp for some.
