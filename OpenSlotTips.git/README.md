# OpenSlotTips v2.5
Slot tips for the newbie to "gaming" (including myself), based off of Professor Slots' tips.


* ***Only spend what you are willing to lose***
* ***Stop spending at about 1/4 profit compared to your budget***
* ***5 pulls, 1 cent, 1-90 credits (maximum)*** required... 
* ***3 pulls, 1 cent, 1-78 credits (maximum)*** recommended... 
	* ***Once per every machine type***
	* ***Once you get the "taste"***, or small initial payout from that machine to entice people, you will want ***go to another type of machine*** as well.
	* Note that ***even if the machines look alike, they can have different payout rates.***
  * To calculate the amount you are going to spend: `CREDITS*SLOT_WORTH=SLOT_SPEND`
* You ***don't have to bet max to get max payback on video slots***
	* So ***try betting as little as possible.***
* If amount of bets and payouts visible, ***prefer more bets over payouts.***
* Try to ***avoid progressive slots.***
  * These are ***slots that, as people put money in, the jackpot grows until someone gets the jackpot***; then it starts over.
* Try betting with machines with ***bonus features, unless it's too expensive.***
* ***Do not use*** a big display of machines.
* **Winning (loose) machines are quite often location-based.**
	* Go to a slot machine
	* Turn around so your back is to it
	* What do you see in front of the machine?
		* If you see a wall, try another slot machine.
		* If you see people looking back at you, that's a good candidate!
		* If it's a popular place (Food court, entrance, bar, etc.) also good!
	* If it's a good candidate, do the "required" values. 
* If it's been more than 3 hours: try once more. If you win a ***micro-taste***: try every 3 hours.
* Note that ***cruise ship casinos have almost 0 regulation.***
	* So nothing is necessarily a thing on said casinos.

## My own tip

* Most if not youtubers who claim to be "casino techs" or something of the like are most likely scam artists.
	* If they ARE a tech, they are likely breaking a NDA, which they really shouldn't want to do.
