# M0 Apple Silli-con.

Inspired by and based on https://github.com/cylance/macos-arm64-emulation ! Run macOS Big Sur Apple A12X (currently shell only, no networking due to lack of PCI support) on Linux or macOS under Intel.

## Disclaimer!

NOTE: This is an early WIP, and we need maintainers to maintain stuff such as PCI/PCIe support for free, as a hobby.

## The goal.

To eventually have a fully functioning virtual Apple ARM Mac to run on an Intel PC (ARM Hackintosh.)
