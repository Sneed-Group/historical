# OpenIdiotProject
***The only reason I didn't name it "OpenOffiz" is to avoid confusion with "OpenOffice". (Also: preventing getting sued played a factor, I guess.)*** (haha dry programmer humor)
## What is the OpenIdiotProject?
Since youareanidiot(dot)org's 18th birthday is getting closer (gosh I feel old), I have made a revised, modern version of the YouAreAnIdiot Jokeware/"Trojan" licensed under the MIT license. (Not the video, just the code. I did not make the video.)
